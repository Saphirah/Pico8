# Pico8 Game Compilation

During my fourth semester at H_DA we had to create 2 games on the virtual game console Pico8.

The games could not be larger than 2 mb and the engine did not provide any logic except draw functions.
Our team consisted of

>Philipp (Me) - Programming<br>
>Leon - Sound Design and 2D Art

### Golfenstein 3D
At first we intended to replicate the old Wolfenstein 3D/Doom Games using a 2D raycasting engine.
After changing the gameplay significantly, we created Golfenstein 3D.

Golfenstein is a first person game that focuses on movement. <br>
You need to evade all enemies and deflect the bullets coming towards you by dashing into them.

### Commando PvP
This project is a real time 1v1 worms-like game. It features fully destructible environment, weapon pickups and procedural maps.
It utilizes the multiscreen feature from pico-8 and fancy bit manipulation.
